Huvudprogram
============
Program for bachelors thesis at instiution for Earth and Space Scienses at Chalmers University of Technology.
Purpuse of the project is to study how waves on the Atlantic Ocean give microseismic effects on a gravitometer at Onsala Space Observatory. This is done by creating Power Spectrums of the data from gravitometer and correlate this with wave heights by using artificial neural networks.

Group consists of:
Erik Hellsten
Emilio Jorge
Markus Polleryd
David Svensson
